# Unity-Threaded-Sending
Sending of model mesh data using c# threads and sockets. 

# Usage
Assign ip + port for sending builds. Sending ip and port must match the address and port you wish to send to. Assign a model to send to the script. Make sure the receiving players script is running before the sending build starts as the model is sent on game start.
